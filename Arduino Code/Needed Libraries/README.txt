These Libraries are needed to run the Arduino program to read from the DS18B20 sensors.

In order to use them, open a sketch got to sketch->Include Libraries->add .zip Library
then navigate to each of the .zip files in this folder ti include them.

This should only need to happen once, subsequent uses of the code should only need 
#include statements.
